# Teamspeak 3 Plugin. Anti-Highpinger/Proxy
This plugin checks the ping of every player and the country - based on his IP-address.

It is also possible to write chat-messages to the BOT. Text like "enable"/"on" or "disable"/"off".

# Why would someone want such a plugin?
We recently had problems with user we could not ban that easily. They just returned with new IP-Addresses - from different countries. So we decided to write that ugly-written plugin.
Currently it kicks every user if his ping exceeds the limit or if he is not from DE, CH or NL (Hardcoded).
