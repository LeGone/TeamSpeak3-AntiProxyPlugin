# Teamspeak 3 Plugin. Anti-Highpinger/Proxy
This plugin checks the ping of every player and the country - based on his IP-address.

You can write "enable"/"on" or "disable"/"off" to the "BOT", to turn the "BOT" on or off.

# Why would someone need such a plugin?
We recently had problems with users we could not ban that easily. They just returned with new IP-Addresses - from different countries. So we decided to write that ugly-written plugin.
Currently it kicks every user if his ping exceeds the limit or if he is not from DE, CH or NL (Hardcoded).
